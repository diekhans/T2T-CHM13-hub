<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These tracks contain macs2 peak calls from Encode histone ChIP-seq experiments aligned to GRCh38p13 and lifted over to the T2T CHM13 v1.0 genome assembly.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Reads were aligned to GRCh38p13 and filtered (see bam pileup track for details). Mapped reads were peak called using macs2 and the parameters "-f BAMPE -g 3.03e9". For the histone marks H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3 also used the parameter "--broad". Tracks were then lifted over using the Lastz-based hg38 to chm13 v1.0 liftover chain file (09/29/2020 version).</p>
