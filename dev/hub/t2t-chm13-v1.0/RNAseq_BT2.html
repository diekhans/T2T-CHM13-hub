<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Native RNA Sequencing Bowtie2 alignment</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The native RNA-seq libraries were done on CHM13 cells using oligodT during library prep and sequenced for 150bp paired-end reads.</p>
<p>Reads were trimmed and filtered and then aligned to the T2T CHM13 v1.0 assembly (released on 20200922) using bowtie2/2.3.5.1 with the following parameters:</p>
<p>-N 0</p>
<p>-k 100</p>
<p>Following alignment, the reads were filtered through samtools F1548 to retain properly paired reads only</p>
