<h2>Description</h2>
<p>CHM13 PRO-seq Bowtie2 default alignments and Meryl unique k-mer filtering (stranded & not stranded)</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The PRO-seq experiment was done on CHM13 cells and sequenced for 75bp single-ended reads.</p>
<p>Reads were trimmed and filtered before mapped with Bowtie2 default</p>
<p>Mapped reads were then filtered through unique genome-wide 51mers</p>
