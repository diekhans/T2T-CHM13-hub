<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Merqury - k-mer multiplicity in assembly</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>All 21-mers in the assembly were counted with meryl count k=21 and annotated along the first base of the k-mer on the assembly with meryl-lookup -dump.


Each beginning position (1-base) of the k-mer was annotated with the global copy number as a .wig file, and converted as bigWig format. As a result, the last 20 bases of an assembly are not included but follows the last 21 baseâ€™s copy number.
