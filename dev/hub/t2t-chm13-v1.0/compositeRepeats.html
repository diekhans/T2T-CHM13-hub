<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Composite repeat track for CHM13v1.0</p>
<p>A composite repeat element is defined as a repeating unit consisting of three or more repeated sequences, including TEs, simple repeats, novel repeat annotations and/or satellites, that is found in at least one location in the genome as a tandem array.</p>
<p>All composite loci are shown as a single block: start-end of the entire tandem array or singleton</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Identification and annotation of composite repeat elements was accomplished through a combination of RepeatMasker(p4.1.2-p1) and extensive manual curation as described in Hoyt et al. 2021</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<!-- if there are special conventions, like colors, describe them here -->
