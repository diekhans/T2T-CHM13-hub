<h3>Description</h3>
This track represents copy number estimates for 266 Simons Genome Diversity Panel genomes. Copy number is estimated over 500 bp windows of uniqely mappable sequence. Sequences are colored from cold to hot (0 - 10+) and exact copy can be found by clicking on the region of interest. \n\n
Additionally, these tracks contain kmer-ized versions of chm13 and hg38 where 36mers with a slide of 1 are used to simulate 30X coverage depth for each reference.
