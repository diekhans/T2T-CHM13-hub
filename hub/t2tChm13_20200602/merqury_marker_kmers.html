<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Merqury - Single copy marker k-mers</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The first 23 bp of the 10X Genomics read pair 1 were trimmed to remove barcode bases,
and 21-mers were collected with Meryl (read set).


21-mers in the multiplicity of >5x and <58x were defined as “single copy k-mers”, which we expect to be found in the haploid assembly once. This set was intersected with the 21-mers found only once in the assembly, to ensure the 21-mer in the assembly is the only place found globally in the assembly.


Each position containing a marker k-mer was converted to a .bed file, with the accumulated number of k-mers per position collected in bigWig format. As a result, the maximum number of k-mers found per base will be 21 (all k-mers overlapping that base are markers).
