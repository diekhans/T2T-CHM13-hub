<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Low coverage support</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
This file contains regions with low coverage support in HiFi, CLR, and ONT platforms.<br><br>

Reads were aligned with <a href=https://github.com/marbl/Winnowmap/releases>Winnowmap 1.11</a>, with the read alignments downloadable <a href="https://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/CHM13#downloads">here</a>.<br><br>

Primary read alignments have been processed with <a href=https://github.com/dfguan/asset>asset commit ver. 0133f268eebf308a1c3eb356b564550526465157</a>, and regions meeting the following criteria are reported in each platform:<br><br>

<li> Less than 10 reads aligned<br>
<li> Merged when regions are less than 1kbp apart<br>
<li> Exclude low coverage at both 1kbp ends of each chromosome due to natural coverage drop<br>
<li> Exclude low coverage overlapping rDNA gaps + 10bp around
</p>
<p>
Two additional files are provided using the same criteria above, except the ONT reads were prefiltered from the primary alignments.<br><br>
<li> low_coverage.30k.bed : Using ONT reads greater than 30 kbp
<li> low_coverage.100k.bed : Using ONT reads greater than 100 kbp
</p>
