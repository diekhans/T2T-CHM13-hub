<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This track contains epigenetics analysis of CHM13  including nanopore methylation calls at both all read lengths and read lengths > 50 kb, CUT&RUN of H3K27me3 and CUT&RUN of H3K4me2.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Nanopore methylation tracks were generated with Nanopolishv.13 using loglik cutoffs of -1.5 and 1.5. CUT&RUN reads were trimmed and filtered before mapped with Bowtie2 -k 100 then filtered through unique genome-wide 51-mers </p>
