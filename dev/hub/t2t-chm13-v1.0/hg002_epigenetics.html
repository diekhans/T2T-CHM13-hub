<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This track contains epigenetics analysis of HG002 cells mapped to T2T-CHM13 including nanopore methylation calls at both all read lengths and read lengths > 50 kb and nanoNOMe accessibility.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Nanopore methylation tracks were generated with Nanopolishv.13 using loglik cutoffs of -1.5/1.5 for CpG and 1.0/-1.0 for GpC. NanoNOMe accessibility track and peak calls were  performed using the methods outlined in Lee et al 2020 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01000-7)</p>
