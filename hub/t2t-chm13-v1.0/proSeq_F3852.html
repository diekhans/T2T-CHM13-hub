<h2>Description</h2>
<p>CHM13 PRO-seq and RNA-seq Bowtie2-F3852 alignments and Meryl unique k-mer filtering</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The PRO-seq experiment was done on CHM13 cells and sequenced for 75bp single-ended reads.</p>
<p>The native RNA-seq libraries were done on CHM13 cells using oligodT during library prep and sequenced for 150bp paired-end reads.</p>
<p>Reads were trimmed and filtered before mapped with Bowtie2 -N 0 -k 100 and samtools filtered (F3852)</p>
<p>Mapped reads were then filtered through two different sets of genome-wide unique k-mers: 21mers, 51mers</p>
