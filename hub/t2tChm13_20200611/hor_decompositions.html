<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Centromere HOR annotation.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Iterative procedure takes AS annotation as input and searches for HOR variant that maximizes AS annotation collapsing on each step.  
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<!-- if there are special conventions, like colors, describe them here -->
<ol>
  <li> Each HOR variant is painted in its own color.
  <li> Canonical HOR is refered by its name: S3CXH1L, S2C8H1L, etc.
  <li> HOR variants are represented by the name of canonical HOR and the list of alpha-satellites it contains:
  	<ol> 
  		<li> HOR variant S2C8H1L_5-11 consists of alpha-satellites 5 to 11 from canonical HOR S2C8H1L.
  		<li> HOR variant S3CXH1L_1-11_7-12 consits of alpha-satelliets 1 to 11 and 7 to 12 from canonical HOR S3CXH1L.  
  	</ol>	
  <li> Reverse complement HOR variants are represented as follows:
  	<ol> 
  		<li> HOR variant S2C8H1L_11-5' is reverse complement to S2C8H1L_5-11. 
  		<li> HOR variant S3CXH1L_12-7'_11-1' is reverse complement to S3CXH1L_1-11_7-12.
  	</ol>
